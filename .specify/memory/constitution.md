# Code Server Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established patterns. Every function and class MUST have a single, clear responsibility. Code reviews MUST enforce style consistency, proper error handling, and adequate documentation. Complex logic MUST be simplified or documented thoroughly.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY for all new features. Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation code. Every feature MUST include unit tests, integration tests, and where applicable, end-to-end tests. Code coverage MUST be maintained above 90% for critical paths. All tests MUST be automated and run in CI/CD pipelines.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST follow consistent design patterns and interaction models. Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly. Response times MUST meet performance benchmarks. Accessibility standards MUST be followed for all user-facing components. Cross-platform consistency MUST be maintained where applicable.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All code MUST meet predefined performance benchmarks. Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed appropriately. Memory usage MUST be monitored and kept within defined limits. Response times for API endpoints MUST be documented and tested. Performance testing MUST be conducted for all critical paths before deployment.

## Quality Standards

### Code Standards
- All code MUST follow language-specific style guides and linting rules
- Functions MUST not exceed 50 lines unless absolutely necessary
- Cyclomatic complexity MUST be kept below 10
- All public APIs MUST be documented with clear examples
- Security best practices MUST be followed for all user input handling

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests MUST cover all business logic paths
- Integration tests MUST verify component interactions
- Performance tests MUST validate response time requirements
- Security tests MUST check for common vulnerabilities
- All tests MUST be deterministic and repeatable

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Standards
- API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms for 95th percentile
- Database queries MUST complete within 100ms on average
- UI interactions MUST feel instantaneous (<100ms perceived latency)
- File upload/download operations MUST provide progress feedback

### Resource Limits
- Memory usage MUST not exceed allocated limits
- CPU usage MUST remain below 80% during normal operation
- Database connections MUST be properly managed and closed
- Temporary files MUST be cleaned up appropriately

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
- Feature branches MUST be created from main/master
- Branch names MUST follow format: feature/[ticket-number]-description
- Pull requests MUST include tests and documentation updates
- Code MUST pass all automated checks before merging

### Review Process
- All code changes MUST undergo peer review
- Reviews MUST check for compliance with constitution principles
- Security-sensitive changes MUST require additional approval
- Performance changes MUST include benchmark validation

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Amendments to this constitution MUST be proposed through pull requests with clear rationale and impact analysis. All changes MUST maintain backward compatibility or include migration plans. Compliance MUST be verified during code reviews and automated checks. Violations MUST be documented and justified with explicit reasoning.
